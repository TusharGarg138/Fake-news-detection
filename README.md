# Fake News Detection (Multimodal + Multilingual)

This project is an end-to-end system that detects fake news using both text and image inputs.  
It combines NLP, deep learning-style processing, and a simple Flask web app to classify news content as Real or Fake.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean, modular, and industry-friendly approach to fake-news analysis.
